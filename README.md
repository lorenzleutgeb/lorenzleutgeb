# README.md

This is a meta-repository that just helps you (and me) navigate all my repositories on GitHub.

## [European Master's in Computational Logic](https://www.emcl-study.eu/)

 * [Seminar paper about Axiom Pinpointing in EL+](https://github.com/lorenzleutgeb/elp)

## [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/)

These repositories contain work I did as a student at Vienna University of Technology.

If you are looking for more material, feel free to hit me up :wink:
